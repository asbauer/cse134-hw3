        <p>Originally born in the Bay Area, I've been fortunate to move around to numerous 
            different areas within the United States. I've lived in colder climates such as Nebraska and North Dakota and more tropical areas such as
            Santa Barbara and now currently San Diego. During my time of getting living in such amazing areas I've become acustomed to 
            befriending a wide variety of people from numerous walks of life. I'm always grateful to continue to meet amazing people, and look forward to continuing this trend. 
        </p>
        <h3 id="education">Education</h3>
        <p>I'm currently in my final year of the Computer Engineering program at UC San Diego. Prior to my studies taking me to San Diego, I was fortunate to study
            at Santa Barbara City College where I obtained my Associates Degrees in Math, Computer Science, and Physics. I've been lucky to work side amazing students 
            who have taught me various methods such as communication and teamwork when applicable. I am passionate about learning, and fully believe that learning is a <i>life long</i> process that never should end.

        <p>In my spare time I'm a member of an on campus organization called Rocket Propulsion Laboratory, or RPL for short, 
            which is an on campus collective of students from various backgrounds with the common goal of creating and launching rocketry. I'm a member of the software team on our flagship rocket, Phoenix, which is slated to launch this year.
            Through my time at RPL I've gotten to work on various tasks such as interacting with Arduino's, software related problems such as implementing a scheduling order of tasks for the on flight computer in which a graph was created using only a linked list but also softer skill items
            such as interacting with the different engineering teams to find out about their needs and gather info from them. 
            Aside from that, I love outdoor activities, calisthenics, watching classic films, and am currently learning the guitar.

            <br>I've recently began to enjoy being able to travel as well. I was fortunate to take part in an amazing journey this summer, which included some time in Porto, Portugal as seen above. 
            Additionally, I'm a big foodie who loves both cooking and exploring the culinary world.
            <aside>
                On that note, if you'd like any restaurant recommendations please don't hesitate to ask! During my travel period I saved numerous folders of amazing restaurants wherever I went!
