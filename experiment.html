                Many browsers, including Chrome a few times, didn't seem to move forward with the idea of supporting it long term 
                until mainly 2023. Firefox does seem to have supported it pretty consistently though. But now that its widely accessible according to
                caniuse (aside from IE) it should allow developers more freedom to use it without worrying quite as much about browser support
